# pychess-lobby-bot

A discord bot that connects [Pychess](https://www.pychess.org) to [discord](https://discord.gg/aPs8RKr) using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). The Bot is hosted on [Heroku's](https://heroku.com/) worker dynos. Check ['Environments'](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-lobby-bot/deployments) to view hosted app (though only the app name can be seen as it runs on worker dynos not web dynos).
